In the heart of the midnight mansion, Epstein hid messages among the lavish rooms.
The island winds carried secrets through the palm groves, where an owl perched quietly.
Rumors drifted like shadows: ledger, flight, mansion, code.
At dawn, mysterious names appeared in the flight logs, while the mansion doors remained locked.
Some whispered about a list hidden under the marble stairs—a code only the clever can decipher.
Between luxury and silence, the owl and the ledger watched over Epstein’s secrets.

Conspicuous words: ledger, owl, mansion, flight, code.
